## Spring Boot 4 + gRPC

Demo project treating gRPC & it's associated protobuf files as first class citizens.

Aim is for this to provide a realistic example of something you'd see in the wild, going beyond the standard medium.com copy paste.

## TODO
- [x] buf server stub generation
- [x] Proto Validate server side validation
- [ ] CI pipeline
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Spring Security
- [ ] Front end client (Flutter app?)
